  Prodcution ready Terraform module to deploy a HA Cardano Stake Pool on AWS

# Canonical GitHub repo
github_repo: osodevops/aws-terraform-module-cardano-stake-pool

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  There are three sections to this module:
  1) Creating the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) which is contains the binaries and default configuration for starting a relay and block producing (Core) node.
  2) Relay and Core configuration / topology files which are managed by Terraform.
  3) Creating both Relay and Core nodes inside separate [AWS Autoscaling group](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) which ensure there is always at least one Relay and Core instance running.

# Example usage

  ### Packer AMI builder variables
  Three variables are required for the `ami/vars/cardano-node-vars.json` file:
    ```yaml
        "packer_build_vpc_id": "vpc-xxxxxxx",
        "packer_build_subnet_id": "subnet-xxxxxx",
        "ami_users":"xxxxxxx",
    ```
    These values will be specefic to the AWS account.
      - `packer_build_vpc_id` VPC ID of the region to build
      - `packer_build_subnet_id` Subnet ID of the region to build
      - `ami_users` AWS Account ID where you want to run AMI

    ### Build command for AWS
    ```aws-vault exec <<aws-profile>> -- packer build -var-file="./ami/vars/cardano-node-vars.json" "./ami/packfiles/cardano-node.json"```

    ### Local development
    To build Cardano node and CLI locally via the Ansible playbook you can run thhe following commands
    ```
      cd ami/ && vagrant up
    ```
